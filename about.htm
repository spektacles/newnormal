		<h1>About</h1><p>
	New Normal is a Portland, Oregon-based label focusing on experimental music (tape loops, malformed techno, futuristic hip hop, noise, fitness video soundtracks, [interesting] ambient, etc.). The label
	was formed in the suburbs of Los Angeles in 2015 by Derrick (aka Sembla) and Sarah, inspired by other local DIY tape labels such as Kerchow Records and Juniper Tree Songs. A move to Portland later that year put the label on hold.
	Derrick, still wanting to contribute to the music scene, came across the Portland beat scene and found kindred spirits. He then founded A Beat Happening, an all-ages electronic/hip hop event at Future Shock Records, a YouTube channel, and record label, 
	with the support of local hip hop producer Luvjonez. This led to two years of all ages events, two fundraisers for Future Shock Records, collaborations with other like-minded collectives, and a 2-day music fest called Forward Frequencies. 
	<br><br>
	After two and a half years, Derrick decided to leave A Beat Happening, which then led to the restarting of New Normal during the pandemic, and a return to focus on more experimental music.  </p>
